# Game-In-Terminal
I've created this game for practicing C#.  
Also I wanted to have something in my portfolio when i was applying to my high school.  
  
*So basically it is simple game in windows terminal, it isn't even fun to play.  
My main focus with this project was on applying and practicing **OOP**.*  

Here's whole project including the source code. Project should'nt be misleed as something importent of mine
it is just a game i made when i was 15. There was only one positive outcome from this. I have sharpen my skills in C# language.
